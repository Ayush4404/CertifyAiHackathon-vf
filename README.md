## 📦 CertifyAI – Decentralized Dataset Certification using IPFS & Pinata(will change to file coin used pinata as it was free)

**CertifyAI** is a full-stack DApp that allows users to upload AI training datasets to decentralized storage (IPFS via Pinata), generate immutable CIDs, and certify them via ZK-like proof simulation. Certified datasets can also be associated with dummy NFTs to simulate Web3 ownership and authenticity.

### 🚀 Features

* 📁 Upload datasets (CSV, JSON, ZIP, Images, etc.)
* 🔐 Store files permanently on IPFS using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/)//will cahnge to filecoin later
* 🆔 Generate and display IPFS CID
* ✅ Certify datasets (adds proof + NFT-like metadata)
* 🧾 View all uploaded and certified datasets
* 🔗 Frontend built with React + Tailwind CSS
* ⚙️ Backend built with Express.js + Multer for uploads
* 📂 All dataset metadata stored locally in `datasets.json`

### 📸 Demo

Coming soon... *(you can host it on Vercel or render.com + backend on Railway)*

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush4404/certifyai.git
cd certifyai
```

#### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret
PORT=4000
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

#### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

> Make sure both frontend (on port 3000) and backend (on port 4000) are running simultaneously.

### ✅ Certification Logic

When a user clicks "Certify":

* A dummy zk-proof hash is added
* A mock NFT metadata structure is generated
* Data is updated in `datasets.json`
