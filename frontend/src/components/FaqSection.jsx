    question: "What is certified AI?",
    answer:
      "Certified AI refers to models trained on datasets that are verifiably authentic, auditable, and tamper-proof, often backed by technologies like ZK-proofs and Filecoin.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does data certification work?",
    answer:
      "We store dataset hashes and ZK-proofs on Filecoin/IPFS. Anyone can verify the authenticity of the data your model was trained on.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does certification matter?",
    answer:
      "Unverified models often hallucinate or produce biased outputs. Certification builds trust, especially in critical domains like healthcare and finance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I audit other models?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If models were published with proof metadata, you can inspect dataset origins and modifications via our UI or CLI tools.",
  },
